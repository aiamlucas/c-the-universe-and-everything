## 1) The Dining Philosophers Problem

**What is it?** A classic synchronization problem in computer science, proposed by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965.


### The Round Table Setup
```
                   ü•¢0
             Phi4        Phi0

           ü•¢4              ü•¢1
                    
         Phi3                Phi1
                  
             ü•¢3            ü•¢2
                 
                    Phi2


With 5 philosophers arranged in a circle:
- Phi0 needs ü•¢0 (left) and ü•¢1 (right)
- Phi1 needs ü•¢1 (left) and ü•¢2 (right)
- Phi2 needs ü•¢2 (left) and ü•¢3 (right)
- Phi3 needs ü•¢3 (left) and ü•¢4 (right)
- Phi4 needs ü•¢4 (left) and ü•¢0 (right) ‚Üê wraps around!
```

### The Setup
- **N philosophers** sit at a round table
- **N chopsticks** placed between them (one between each pair)
- Each philosopher alternates between three activities:
  - **EATING** (requires 2 chopsticks: left AND right)
  - **THINKING** (requires no chopsticks)
  - **SLEEPING** (requires no chopsticks)

### The Challenge
- Philosophers **share chopsticks** (limited resources)
- They **don't communicate** with each other
- They **must not starve** (die from not eating)
- The system **must not deadlock**  (all threads stuck waiting for each other in a circle ‚Üí nobody can proceed)

### Real-World Analogy
Think of it like multiple programs trying to access shared resources (files, memory, network connections). If not coordinated properly, they can:
- **Deadlock**: all waiting for each other
- **Starve**: some processes never get resources
- **Race**: corrupt data by simultaneous access

## 2) CPU, Cores, and Threads

Before diving into processes and threads, it‚Äôs important to understand how the CPU actually runs them.


### The CPU Hierarchy

| **Component**        | **Description**                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU (Processor)**  | The physical chip that performs computation. A typical personal computer usually has one CPU                                                 |
| **Core**             | An independent execution unit inside the CPU. Each core can execute its own thread of instructions.                                          |
| **Hardware Thread**  | Also called a *logical core*. Some CPUs use Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) or Hyper-Threading to run two threads per core simultaneously. |
| **Software Thread**  | The thread you create in your program (e.g., using `pthread_create`). The operating system scheduler assigns these to hardware threads.      |

### Example: Ryzen 7 CPU
Let‚Äôs take an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X as a real-world example:

| **Property**                  | **Value**                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Physical CPUs**             | 1 (one processor chip)     |
| **Cores per CPU**             | 8 cores                    |
| **Hardware Threads per Core** | 2 (SMT enabled)            |
| **Total Hardware Threads**    | 8 √ó 2 = 16 logical threads |

So the operating system sees 16 logical CPUs, meaning up to 16 software threads can run truly in parallel.  
If you create more than 16 threads, the OS will time-slice them, giving each a short turn on the cores.

### How Execution Works
1. Each core can run one (or two with SMT/Hyper-Threading) threads at once.  
2. The operating system scheduler decides which software threads run on which cores.  
3. If there are more threads than cores, the OS quickly switches between them (context switching).  
4. This creates:  
   - **True parallelism** when enough cores exist  
   - **Concurrent execution** when threads share cores via time slicing

### Threads and CPU Cores

Each thread represents a sequence of instructions that the CPU can execute.  
Modern CPUs have multiple cores, and each core can run one or more threads at the same time (thanks to hyper-threading or SMT).

| **Concept**           | **Explanation**                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Core**              | A physical processing unit inside the CPU. Each core can run one thread (or two with SMT).                             |
| **Thread**            | A lightweight task that the OS scheduler assigns to a CPU core for execution.                                          |
| **Parallelism**       | Multiple threads can run truly simultaneously if there are multiple cores available.                                   |
| **Context Switching** | If there are more threads than cores, the OS quickly switches between them to give the illusion of parallelism.        |
| **Performance Note**  | More threads ‚â† always faster ‚Äî performance depends on how much real parallel work exists and synchronization overhead. |


### Example

```
// Suppose you have a Ryzen 7 5800X (8 cores, 16 threads):
CPU (Ryzen 7 5800X)
 ‚îú‚îÄ Core 0  ‚Üí Thread A
 ‚îú‚îÄ Core 1  ‚Üí Thread B
 ‚îú‚îÄ Core 2  ‚Üí Thread C
 ‚îú‚îÄ Core 3  ‚Üí Thread D
 ‚îú‚îÄ Core 4  ‚Üí Thread E
 ‚îú‚îÄ Core 5  ‚Üí Thread F
 ‚îú‚îÄ Core 6  ‚Üí Thread G
 ‚îî‚îÄ Core 7  ‚Üí Thread H

// Each core supports 2 hardware threads (SMT):
‚Üí Total = 8 cores √ó 2 = 16 hardware threads.
```

The Ryzen 7 5800X can run up to 16 threads truly in parallel.  
If your program creates 200 threads, the operating system scheduler will rotate them among those 16 hardware threads, giving each a short time slice to execute.

```
// Example: Thread scheduling (conceptual)
for (int i = 0; i < n_threads; i++)
    pthread_create(...);  // Threads may run on different CPU cores (Ryzen 7 cores)
```

## 3) Processes vs Threads

Before diving into threads, it's important to understand the difference from processes and threads:

| **Aspect**        | **Process**                 | **Thread**                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Memory Space**  | Separate (isolated)         | Shared within process           |
| **Creation Cost** | Expensive (fork syscall)    | Cheap (just new stack)          |
| **Communication** | IPC needed (pipes, signals) | Direct (shared variables)       |
| **Crash Impact**  | Isolated                    | Can crash entire process        |
| **Use Case**      | Independent programs        | Concurrent tasks in one program |

### Why Threads for Philosophers?
- **Shared memory**: All philosophers can see the same chopsticks (mutex array)
- **Fast**: Creating 200 philosopher threads is much faster than 200 processes
- **Simple communication**: No need for complex IPC

```
// Process model (NOT used in this project)
for (int i = 0; i < n_philos; i++)
    fork();  // Creates separate process, needs IPC

// Thread model (what we use)
for (int i = 0; i < n_philos; i++)
    pthread_create(...);  // Creates thread, shares memory
```

---

## 4) POSIX Threads (pthreads)

### What is a Thread?
A **thread** is a **separate flow of execution** within the same program. Think of it like having multiple workers in the same office (shared memory) doing different tasks simultaneously.

### Key Thread Functions

#### `pthread_create()`
Creates and starts a new thread.

```
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread,           // thread ID (output)
                   const pthread_attr_t *attr,  // attributes (usually NULL)
                   void *(*start_routine)(void*), // function to run
                   void *arg);                  // argument to pass

// Example:
pthread_t philo_thread;
t_philo philo_data = {...};
pthread_create(&philo_thread, NULL, philosopher_routine, &philo_data);
```

- **Returns**: 0 on success, error code otherwise
- **`start_routine`**: The function the thread will execute
- **`arg`**: Pointer passed to your function (your philosopher's data)

#### `pthread_join()`
Waits for a thread to finish (blocks until thread terminates).

```
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);

// Example:
pthread_join(philo_thread, NULL);  // Wait for philosopher to finish
```

- Like `waitpid()` for processes
- **Main thread must join** all philosopher threads before exiting
- **Retval**: Can capture thread's return value (usually NULL for this project)

#### `pthread_detach()`
Marks thread as detached (resources auto-released on exit).

```
int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);
```

- **Detached threads**: Cannot be joined, clean up automatically
- **Use case**: If you don't care about thread's return value

### Thread Lifecycle
```
[CREATED] --pthread_create()--> [RUNNING] --function returns--> [TERMINATED]
                                    |
                                    |--pthread_join()--> [JOINED/CLEANED UP]
```

### Example: Basic Thread

```
void *print_message(void *arg)
{
    char *msg = (char *)arg;
    printf("%s\n", msg);
    return (NULL);
}

int main(void)
{
    pthread_t thread;
    char *message = "Hello from thread!";
    
    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, print_message, message);
    pthread_join(thread, NULL);  // Wait for completion
    return (0);
}
```

---

## 5) Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion)

### What is a Mutex?
A **mutex** (mutual exclusion lock) is like a **lock on a door**. Only one thread can hold the lock at a time.

**In Philosophers**: Each Chopstick is protected by a mutex.

### Why Do We Need Mutexes?

Without mutexes:
```
// Thread 1                    // Thread 2
chopsticks[1] = TAKEN;              chopsticks[1] = TAKEN;  // Both think they got it!
// Both philosophers now "have" Chopstick 1 ‚Üí CONFLICT
```

With mutexes:
```
// Thread 1                              // Thread 2
pthread_mutex_lock(&chopsticks[1]);      pthread_mutex_lock(&chopsticks[1]);
chopsticks[1] = TAKEN;                   // BLOCKED - waiting for Thread 1
pthread_mutex_unlock(&chopsticks[1]);
                                         // NOW Thread 2 can proceed
                                         chopsticks[1] = TAKEN;
```

### Key Mutex Functions

#### `pthread_mutex_init()`
Initializes a mutex.

```
int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex,
                       const pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);

// Example:
pthread_mutex_t chopstick_mutex;
pthread_mutex_init(&chopstick_mutex, NULL);  // NULL = default attributes
```

#### `pthread_mutex_destroy()`
Destroys a mutex (frees resources).

```
int pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

// Must be called when done with mutex
pthread_mutex_destroy(&chopstick_mutex);
```

#### `pthread_mutex_lock()`
Acquires the mutex (blocks if already locked).

```
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

// Thread will WAIT here if another thread holds the lock
pthread_mutex_lock(&chopstick_mutex);
// Critical section - only one thread at a time
pthread_mutex_unlock(&chopstick_mutex);
```

#### `pthread_mutex_unlock()`
Releases the mutex.

```
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```

**CRITICAL**: Always unlock what you lock! Forgetting this causes deadlocks.

### Mutex Example: Protecting Shared Data

```
pthread_mutex_t print_mutex;
int shared_counter = 0;

void *increment(void *arg)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
    {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&print_mutex);
        shared_counter++;  // Protected operation
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&print_mutex);
    }
    return (NULL);
}
```

Without the mutex, `shared_counter` would have a **race condition** and the final value would be unpredictable.

---

## 6) Race Conditions

### What is a Race Condition?
When **multiple threads access shared data** and at least one is **writing**, and the **outcome depends on timing**.

### Example: The Classic Race

```
// Global variable (shared by all threads)
int balance = 1000;

// Thread 1: Deposit $100        // Thread 2: Withdraw $50
int temp1 = balance;             int temp2 = balance;
temp1 = temp1 + 100;             temp2 = temp2 - 50;
balance = temp1;                 balance = temp2;
```

**Possible outcomes**:
1. Thread 1 first, Thread 2 second ‚Üí `1050` ‚úì
2. Thread 2 first, Thread 1 second ‚Üí `1100` ‚úì
3. **INTERLEAVED** ‚Üí Could be `1050`, `950`, or anything!

### Race in Philosophers

```
// BAD: No mutex protection
if (chopsticks[left] == AVAILABLE)  // Check
{
    chopsticks[left] = TAKEN;       // Set
}

// Two philosophers could BOTH pass the check before either sets it!
```

**Solution**: Atomic operation with mutex:
```
pthread_mutex_lock(&Chopstick[left]);
// Now ONLY this thread can access Chopstick[left]
chopsticks[left] = TAKEN;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&Chopstick[left]);
```

---

## 7) Deadlock

### What is Deadlock?
When **all threads are waiting** for resources held by each other ‚Üí **nobody can proceed**.

### The Classic Philosophers Deadlock
```
Philosopher 1: Holds Chopstick 1, wants Chopstick 2
Philosopher 2: Holds Chopstick 2, wants Chopstick 3
Philosopher 3: Holds Chopstick 3, wants Chopstick 4
Philosopher 4: Holds Chopstick 4, wants Chopstick 1
```

**Everyone is waiting. Forever. Deadlock.**

### Deadlock Conditions (All 4 must be true)
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources can't be shared (chopsticks can't be split)
2. **Hold and Wait**: Thread holds resources while waiting for more
3. **No Preemption**: Can't forcibly take resources from a thread
4. **Circular Wait**: Circular chain of threads waiting for each other

### Breaking Deadlock in Philosophers

**Strategy 1: Different lock order**
```
// Even philosophers: left Chopstick first
if (philo_id % 2 == 0)
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(&chopsticks[left]);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&chopsticks[right]);
}
// Odd philosophers: right Chopstick first
else
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(&chopsticks[right]);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&chopsticks[left]);
}
```

**Strategy 2: Global ordering**
```
// Always lock the lower-numbered Chopstick first
int first = (left < right) ? left : right;
int second = (left < right) ? right : left;

pthread_mutex_lock(&chopsticks[first]);
pthread_mutex_lock(&chopsticks[second]);
```

**Strategy 3: Delay odd philosophers**
```
if (philo_id % 2 == 1)
    usleep(100);  // Give even philosophers a head start
```

---

## 8) Thread Synchronization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Stop-and-Wait (Used in Minitalk)
One signal at a time with acknowledgment.

### Pattern 2: Producer-Consumer
One thread produces data, another consumes it (needs condition variables - not for this project).

### Pattern 3: All-Start-Together
All threads start simultaneously, but coordinate with timing/mutexes. (ideal for the philosophers project)

```
// Create all threads first
for (int i = 0; i < n_philos; i++)
    pthread_create(&philos[i], NULL, routine, &data[i]);

// They all start running at roughly the same time
```

### The Chopstick Dance: Philosophers Pattern

```
void *philosopher_routine(void *arg)
{
    t_philo *philo = (t_philo *)arg;
    
    while (!simulation_ended())
    {
        think(philo);
        
        // ACQUIRE chopsticks (critical!)
        take_forks(philo);
        
        // EAT (protected by holding chopsticks)
        eat(philo);
        
        // RELEASE chopsticks
        drop_forks(philo);
        
        sleep_philo(philo);
    }
    return (NULL);
}
```

---

## 9) Time Management

### `gettimeofday()`
Gets current time with microsecond precision.

```
#include <sys/time.h>

int gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv, struct timezone *tz);

struct timeval {
    time_t      tv_sec;   // seconds
    suseconds_t tv_usec;  // microseconds
};

// Example: Get timestamp in milliseconds
long long get_time_ms(void)
{
    struct timeval tv;
    
    gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
    return ((tv.tv_sec * 1000) + (tv.tv_usec / 1000));
}
```

### `usleep()`
Suspends execution for microseconds.

```
#include <unistd.h>

int usleep(useconds_t microseconds);

// Example: Sleep for 200ms
usleep(200 * 1000);  // 200,000 microseconds = 200ms
```

**Note**: `usleep` is not perfectly precise. Actual sleep time may be slightly longer due to scheduling.

### Timestamp Pattern in Philosophers

```
// At start of simulation
long long start_time = get_time_ms();

// In philosopher thread
long long current_time = get_time_ms();
long long elapsed = current_time - start_time;
printf("%lld %d is eating\n", elapsed, philo_id);
```

### Death Timer Pattern

```
typedef struct s_philo
{
    long long last_meal_time;  // When they last started eating
    long long time_to_die;     // How long they can survive
    // ... other fields
} t_philo;

// Check if philosopher died
long long time_since_meal = get_time_ms() - philo->last_meal_time;
if (time_since_meal > philo->time_to_die)
{
    printf("%lld %d died\n", get_time_ms() - start_time, philo->id);
    // End simulation
}
```

---

## 10) Data Races vs Race Conditions

### Data Race
**Simultaneous access** to the same memory location by multiple threads, where at least one is writing, **with no synchronization**.

```
// DATA RACE (undefined behavior)
// Thread 1              // Thread 2
x = 1;                   x = 2;

// The value of x is unpredictable
// The program behavior is undefined
```

### Race Condition
**The outcome depends on timing** of thread execution.

```
// RACE CONDITION (logic error)
// Thread 1                          // Thread 2
if (account_balance >= 100)         if (account_balance >= 100)
    account_balance -= 100;             account_balance -= 100;

// If both check before either subtracts, balance could go negative!
```

### In Philosophers
- **Data race**: Reading/writing to `last_meal_time` without mutex protection
- **Race condition**: Two philosophers trying to grab the same Chopstick at once

**Solution for both**: Use mutexes correctly!

## Summary: Key Concepts

| **Concept**        | **What**                  | **Why in Philosophers**                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Thread**         | Parallel execution flow   | Each philosopher runs independently         |
| **Mutex**          | Lock protecting resource  | Each Chopstick needs protection             |
| **Deadlock**       | All threads stuck waiting | Can happen if all grab left Chopstick first |
| **Race Condition** | Timing-dependent bug      | Multiple philos accessing same Chopstick    |
| **Data Race**      | Unprotected memory access | Reading/writing `last_meal_time`            |
| **gettimeofday**   | Get precise timestamp     | Track when philosophers last ate            |
| **usleep**         | Sleep for microseconds    | Simulate eating/sleeping time               |
